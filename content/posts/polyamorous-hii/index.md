Title: what even is polyamory;
---

if you look up the definition of polyamory, youll likely
find something heavily buffered and convoluted, trying to
get you to scroll down on a page with 15 ads per word just
for a simple definition that could not be easier

### tl;dr

being polyamorous means that you can feel romantic attraction
of similar if not the same strength to multiple people at one
time.

it is not intrinsically sexual, and anyone who tries to tell
you that is trying to scare you. it's not immoral, everyone
in the equation is consenting.

i am currently in a triad, meaning that there are three people,
all polyamorous, who all love each other romantically.

think you're polyamorous? great! dont let people thinking of
polyamory as intrinsically sexual or people thinking its immoral
by simple factor of being different bring you down, live your
own life as best you can :D

## common polyamorous dating schemes

### triad/quad/etc

in many modern polyamorous relationships, you'll see a common
schema (like the one i'm in currently) thats referred to by
the amount of people in it, specifically triad and quad.

these terms imply that everyone in the group (all three or all
four) are dating each other, no one goes unloved by anyone else.

### "open relationship"

whilst having an open relationship doesnt have to mean you're
polyamorous, if the openness of a 2+ person relationship allows
you to have additional romantic partners then anyone in that
relationship who does have extra romantic partners is categorically
polyamorous.

### others

of course there are more ways to be poly, but really poly is being
about loving more than one person romantically, and any way you
choose to do that is categorically within this list.
